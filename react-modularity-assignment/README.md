# React Modularity Assignment
This project is a simple React application demonstrating the use of components, modularity, and import/export methods to create a structured and maintainable codebase.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v12.x or later)
npm (Node Package Manager)
You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal respectively.

## Getting Started
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-modularity-assignment.git`
`cd react-modularity-assignment`

2. Install Dependencies
Next, install the project dependencies by running:

Copy code
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary packages for the application to run.

3. Start the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, start the development server by running:
npm start
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes you make to the application code will be reflected immediately without needing to refresh the browser.

Using the Application
Once the application is running, you should see the main interface with a header, footer, and content sections. You can interact with the application directly through the web interface provided.

Modifying the Application
Feel free to explore the codebase and make modifications to the components to see how changes affect the application. The project is structured to encourage modularity and reuse of components.
